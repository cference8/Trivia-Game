## Usability Section

For the usability section, please perform each survey with just yourself and the user. Try to get individuals from different backgrounds in terms of age, gender, gaming interest, cultural background, etc. After the user is done, please add your own observations at the bottom of the survey regarding the users' reactions, as well as your own suggestions to improve how the game works based on the users' feedback. Save the document as `Usability-Survey-Trivia-STUDENT-USER.docx`, replacing `STUDENT` with your name and `USER` with the name of the person taking the survey.

You will have two weeks to make your modifications, upload the file to GitHub, and perform your usability testing. Upload the following files to D2L:

- The customized Hype file.
- The compressed HTML folder containing the game.
- Two completed usability test forms.

Also, make sure to include the GitHub URL in the comments.
